        <p>Zaq is a PHP based template parser engine developed to work with Codeigniter. This library has been developed for developers to integrate php codes in views easily. Using this library will also allow the view file to be more readable. View files in Codeigniter (or in any other framework following MVC) always contains both html and php codes which make them a bit harder to read. This problem can be eradicated by using a parser engine which makes the view files a lot more easier to work with.</p>

        <p>The basic process of providing a HTML form for uploading user submitted files to the server with PHP is fairly easy and simple. But there are some security implications that many of us are unaware of. We will be building a custom PHP class for secure file upload. This class will check the type and size of the file and rename the file in case of duplication.</p>

The basic process of uploading user submitted files to the server with PHP is fairly easy and simple. But there should be some security measures. What will happen if a bad user uploads a malicious file to our server?</p>
