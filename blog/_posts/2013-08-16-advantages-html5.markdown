HTML5 is the new definition of web designing. It has been designed to replace both HTML 4, XHTML, and the HTML DOM Level 2. HTML5 is specially designed to deliver rich content without the need for additional plugins. The current version delivers everything from animation to graphics, music to movies, and can also be used to build complicated web applications. HTML5 is also cross-platform. It is designed to work whether you are using a PC, or a Tablet, a Smartphone, or a Smart TV.

Lets discuss some advantages or beneficial features of HTML5.

<br>

## Mutuality

The developers make websites highly interactive nowadays, to keep up with the demands of the user. For this purpose, they need to incorporate fluid animations, stream video, music and Social Network site links, like those of Facebook and Twitter, into the websites. Now, with the help of HTML5, it is possible to embed video & audio, high quality drawings, charts & animation and much more rich content, without using any plug-ins or any other computer programs.

## Improved Codes

HTML5 enables web designers to use cleaner, neater code, we can remove most div tags and replace them with semantic HTML5 elements.

<br>

## Improved Semantics

It is now easy to see which parts of the page are headers, navigators, footers, aside functions, etc and most importantly, know what their meaning and purpose is in the whole format, as the tags for these functions are more specific. By using HTML5 elements, we can increase the semantic value of the web page, as the codes are very standardized.

## Elegant Forms

HTML5 enables designer to use fancier forms. It even makes form validation native to HTML, enables user interface enhancements and reduces need for JavaScript (but you need modern browser).

<br>

## Consistency

As websites adopt the new HTML5 elements, we will see greater consistency in terms of the HTML used to code a web page. This will make it easier for designers and developers to immediately understand how a web page is structured.

<br>

## Improved Accessibility

HTML5 and its elements enable more detailed understanding of the structure of a page and make the technologies and features of web design more accessible.

<br>

## Web Application Development

Many new features and standards have emerged, as part of HTML5. Once you understand the available features in the browsers today, you can utilize them in your application and keep up with the changing trends. The main objective of HTML5 is to make web application easier with easy front-ends, drag and drop tools, discussion boards, wikis and other useful elements.

## Offline Application Cache

While building the site, a developer can now specify the files that he would want the browser to cache. This way, if you refresh the page when you are offline, the page will still load correctly. This has several advantages like offline browsing, files loading much faster and reduced load on the server.

<br>

## User Database

HTML5 has two storage devices â€“ Session Storage and Local Storage, instead of the cookies, used to track user data, which could cause disadvantages with tedious repair procedures. It is not a permanent database, but enables you to store structured data, temporarily.

<br>

## Geo-location

Geo-location is used to track your location and share it with others. Your IP address, wireless network connection, the cell tower your phone is connected to, or the recent GPS hardware can all help in tracking your location. The new HTML5 Geo-location APIs make information, about your location, generated via GPS or other methods, directly available to any application with an HTML5-compatible browser.
